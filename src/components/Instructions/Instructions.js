        <p>
          <span>1.</span> You need to get a free zoom account â€“
          <a
            className="instr"
            href="https://zoom.us/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            https://zoom.us
          </a>
          â€“ ideally on an ipad (its an app) or laptop (youâ€™ll need to download a
          bit of software) and not a mobile phone if possible. It is a very
          simple and quick process to sign up for with an email address. Then
          perhaps test it, and familiarise yourself and maybe your child with it
          a little.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>2.</span> Sign up for a 30 min lesson time through the link on
          this website above â€“ these are scheduled in 30 minute increments - and
          we are both notified of the booked slot â€“ when you confirm you are
          attending it shows on my calendar. Availability is shown in real time
          â€“ so we canâ€™t double book.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>3.</span> At the start of the day you will be emailed by me an
          invite link to the zoom lesson.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>4.</span> A few minutes before your allocated time get set up!
          Position the device for the zoom lesson so the drum kit can be seen â€“
          remember the drum kit needs to be heard also â€“ I will have emailed how
          to do this..{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>5.</span> Make sure the volume of the device is turned up.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>6.</span> Make sure that any sheet music / note book needed is
          there ready.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>7.</span> Sticks at the ready too!
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>8.</span> In the few minutes before the lesson click on the zoom
          link that was emailed to you â€“ this will take you to a virtual waiting
          room â€“ so that you are ready. I will be able to see that you are
          logged on and ready.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>9.</span> Please do adhere to timings â€“ it is quite likely I
          will have back to back drum lessons booked in â€“ so you will lose time
          if you are late logging in.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>10.</span> At the time of your lesson I will make the link to
          open and start the lesson â€“ and thatâ€™s itâ€¦{" "}
          <span role="img" aria-label="we're off">
            weâ€™re off ðŸš€
          </span>
